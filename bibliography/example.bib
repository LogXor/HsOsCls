abstract = {The Xilinx{\textregistered} UltraScale™ architecture enables multi-hundred gigabit-per-second levels of
system performance with smart processing, while efficiently routing and processing data
on-chip. UltraScale architecture-based devices address a vast spectrum of high-bandwidth,
high-utilization system requirements by using industry-leading technical innovations,
including next-generation routing, ASIC-like clocking, 3D-on-3D ICs, multiprocessor SoC
technologies, and new power reduction features. The devices share many building blocks,
providing scalability across process nodes and product families to leverage system-level
investment across platforms.},

abstract = {This letter analyses and compares on-chip interfaces for hardware/software communications in the Zynq-7000 all programmable systems-on-chip. Many experiments were carried out to evaluate the exchange of data between the processing system and the programmable logic through general-purpose and high-performance ports; the experiments were conducted for both standalone and Linux applications. The results enable the most effective interfaces for specific types of data to be identified and the effectiveness of Zynq-based hardware accelerators to be assessed.},
